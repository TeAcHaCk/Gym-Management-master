# gym-management
Gym Management System provides an easy-to-use interface for users as well as a database for the admin to keep track of gym members' records.
In this project, I have used joins, triggers, procedures, and aggrigate functions for basic operations like add, delete, and update.

# Trigger Function
When a payment is deleted from the table, it is saved in Payment_history.

# Procudure Fucntion
You update a member's first name, last name, and email address.

# Installation Process
Step 1: Save the file to the "xampp\htdocs" directory.


Step 2: Create a database in MariaDB or phpMyAdmin, naming the database as "loginsystem" and import the (/loginsystem.sql) file, or type in MariaDB's command-line source "/path/loginsystem.sql."

Step 3: in web brower Go to the "\xampp\htdocs\Gym-Management-master"
